The problem description
-----------------------

Consider the following picture:

7             ####
6             ######
5   ##        ######
4   ##      ########
3   ##    ##########
2 ####  ############
1 ##################
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8


In this picture we have walls of different heights.
This picture is represented by an array of integers,
where the value at each index is the height of the wall.
The picture above is represented with an array as [2,5,1,2,3,4,7,7,6].

So, first input parameter is array of Integer,
where array length is the quantity of walls
and the value at each index is the height of the wall.

Now imagine it rains.
The second input parameter is range of indexes where it rains.
On the picture below values are [0, 8].

How much water is going to be accumulated in puddles between walls?

For example:

7             ####
6             ######
5   ##~~~~~~~~######
4   ##~~~~~~########
3   ##~~~~##########
2 ####~~############
1 ##################
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

We count volume in square blocks of 1X1.
So in the picture above, everything to the left of index 1 spills out.
Water to the right of index 7 also spills out.
We are left with a puddle between 1 and 6 and the volume is 10.
